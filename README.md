# portfolio-week-2

For my first portfolio I wanted to do a color pallete of black, white, and yellow.
This has been made into a responsive portfolio using flexblox in css.

### Future update for html
Will need to fix up some of the semantic code throughout the course as it is slightly messy.
Figure out a better clean font family for all the sections.

## Nav bar

The nav bar is a basic black bar with 3 ahref links for navigation. Very plain but looks good with the color scheme.
Function 
The links will navigate the user to the section that cooresponds to the a appropriate little.

### Future updates
In the future I plan to add an Icon on the left side of of the nav by itself for more style and fill in the empty space.


## About Me section

The about me section is also a little bit plain for this prototype I couldnt figure out what to put
currently. Has an introduction with lorem ipsum to fill in some space until I have a more indepth intro for myself.

Attached with a picture using drop shadow to make it look a little bit more dynamic.
Possibly will add more sections or icons.

## Project Section

This section uses the black white and yellow color scheme as seen on the top with 4 div layers also responsive using flex blox.
When entering mobile view it will go into a coloumn view. Currently functionality has not been added to link to anything cause I 
do not have any worthy projects to attach. Will update as it goes on. 

### Future updates
Will attach images to projects
A hover funtion that drops down text to show show desription of project and will link to github.
And will add animations to make it more dynamic.


## Contact Section

This contact section uses a contact me form. That will let the user send an email. This functionality will be updated
once I attached  javascript to it.


#### Future update for contact
Will add more css to the input boxes and icons for more style and presentation.


## Footer 
This footer uses the same layout as the nav section but with social media links instead + A top link that will bring the users 
back to the top of the page.
